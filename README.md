RxJava Binding APIs for Facebook's Android SDK.

This is currently in experimental phase. Use with care.

## Download
```groovy
compile 'com.christiangp:RxFacebook:<latest-version>'
```

## Usage

### Signing in

Subscribe to `RxFacebook.logIn()`.

Make sure `RxFacebook.logIn()` is done in the UI Thread (typically by observing on `mainThread()` before it)

The generated `Observable` holds a strong reference to the host `Activity`. 
Remember to dispose the subscription `Disposable` once you're done with it (typically in the `onDestroy()` method) to free this reference.

That's it. No need to handle any `onActivityResult()`.

```java
Disposable loginDisposable =
  RxFacebook.logIn(activity, permissions)
            .subscribe(
              result -> {
                if (result instanceof LoginResultCanceledEvent) {
                  //Do something on canceled
                } else if (result instanceof LoginResultSuccessfulEvent) {
                  final LoginResult loginResult = ((LoginResultSuccessfulEvent) result).loginResult();
                  //Do something with loginResult on success
                }
              },
              throwable -> {
                //Do something on error
              }
            );
```

### Graph API requests
Subscribe to `RxFacebook.graphRequest()`

```java
final Bundle params = new Bundle();
params.putString("fields", 
  "id, birthday, first_name, gender, last_name, link, location, locale, name, timezone, updated_time, email"
);

RxFacebook.graphRequest(AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken(), "me", params, HttpMethod.GET)
          .subscribe(graphResponse -> {
              // Do somehitng with graphResponse
          });
```
